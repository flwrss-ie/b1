            Everyone knows the great artist Leonardo da Vinci, the one who painted Mona Lisa. 
            But, did you know he kept small laboratories and dissected animals? Since, past, artists have indulged into bio-art.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the last three decades, artists have cultivated human tissue, assembled DNA profiles, and used modified bacteria as electrical transmitters. And these works were put up for exhibits, museums, and art festivals. This type of work is called as ‘Bio-art’. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The term ‘bioart’ was first used in 1997, when Eduardo Kac, performed on live TV called ‘Time Capsule’. Kac’s performance consisted of implanting a microchip in his left ankle and then registering himself in a pet database for the implant as both the owner and pet, officially becoming the first human to do so. Since then, bioart has been practiced widely across the globe. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The mix of biotechnology and art has made artists come with innovative ideas. The Museum of Modern Art in New York has featured a number of bioart exhibits. One called “Victimless Leather” was a tiny jacket made from living mouse tissue, housed inside an environmentally controlled glass ball. Unfortunately, it was forced to kill as the cells were very much alive and they were multiplying at fast rate.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Another bioart project that certainly caught a lot of people’s attention was “bulletproof skin”. This included lab-grown human skin with one of nature’s strongest substances- spider silk. This modified skin was able to stop low caliber bullets. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The first transgenic art was created in mid-1980s. The piece was entitled- Microvenus, was produced by Joe Davis. It consisted of a strand of DNA encoded with symbol of the Germanic rune for life inserted into E.coli bacterium (rune is an abstraction of female genitalia).  
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional academic or labs, bioart doesn’t focus on projects to some greater medical or biological necessity. It more focusses on putting knowledge and creativity together. It focuses on beautiful innovations. Nurit Bar-Shai, who is an artist, uses the laboratory to grow kaleidoscopic colonies of Paenibacillus vortex, a bacterium commonly found in soil. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Science and art is often considered as two opposite fields. But scientists today are bringing their artistic nature into science. Creativity is surely an important pillar towards scientific progress. The beauty and complexity of biology makes it a fascinating subject for artists to explore the field.
